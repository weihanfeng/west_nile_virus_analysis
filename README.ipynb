    "Due to the epidemic of West Nile Virus (WNV) in the Chicago, the Department of Public Health set up a surveillance and control system to learn something about the mosquito population and WNV incidence from the data over time. \n",
    "As part of the hiring assessment for the new data science team, we have been tasked to analyse the historical data and developed a robust predicted model. It is hoped that the department could make use of insights from the analysis and model to derive more targeted plans to control the outbreak of WNV in Chicago, taking into account the cost and benefits of any future mitigaion measures.

Due to our focus on curbing future outbreaks, the low precision is not a focus for this project, although future improvements such as better features, more rigourous feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, and more advanced models such as XGboost and Recurrent Neural Networks would definitely serve to improve our results."
